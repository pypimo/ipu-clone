# IPU-Ranklist-Clone
The site is deployed at `https://pypimo.github.io/ipu-clone`
This project is a clone of the IPU-ranklist `https://www.ipuranklist.com`

## Technology used
I have used:
- HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Javascript
- Chart.js library for graphs

## Features
Since the API for the ranklist is not publically accessible, the data is included in the repo for the respective batches.

1. The buttons and elements on navbar lead you to different websites
2. For now, results are only availble for USICT B.Tech. 
3. The Search button fetches the data and displays it on the table. Also refreshes the chart.
